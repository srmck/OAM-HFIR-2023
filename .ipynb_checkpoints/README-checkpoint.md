# OAM-HFIR-502
Simulations for the transmission of neutron beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM) in polarized 3He and the measurement of spin-texture in the neutron beam. 

The 3He-OAM simulations will be used to compare the semiclassical expectation with the quantum experimental results.

Things to add for 3He:
1. Adiabatic action of the nutators
2. Cryocup tunes
3. Spin-dependent detectors
4. Recalculate the transmission for the polarizaed 3He with the "Bulldog" cell
5. (extra) Write new McStas component for the polarized 3He

Things to add for spin texture experiment:
1. Find the 2D semsans period 
2. Calculate the OAM content of the beam
